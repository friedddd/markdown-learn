DEVLOG — Markdown Learning Site
================================

2026-02-05 — Project Start
- Created ~/markdown-learn/ directory
- Plan finalized: 3-file static site (index.html, style.css, app.js)
- Using `marked` via CDN for markdown rendering
- Desaturated EPCOT 1982 palette, light/dark theme support
- Starting implementation...

2026-02-05 — Initial Build Complete
- index.html: HTML shell with home, learn, and practice sections + answer modal
- style.css: Full desaturated EPCOT palette (light/dark), Notion-style rendered
  markdown, responsive layout, TOC dropdown, modal overlay
- app.js:
  - Theme toggle with localStorage persistence + system preference detection
  - View routing (Home → Learn / Practice, cross-links)
  - Learn section: 13 pages of progressive content, each with side-by-side
    raw markdown / rendered examples. Keyboard arrow nav, clickable TOC dropdown.
  - Practice section: 9 tiers of randomly-generated challenges (headings →
    mixed/advanced). Validation with normalization, Show Answer modal,
    Ctrl+Enter submit, auto-advance on correct.
- Using marked.js via CDN for all markdown rendering
- Testing next...

2026-02-05 — Bugfix: Modal visible on load
- .modal-overlay had `display: flex` which overrode the HTML `hidden` attribute
- Added `.modal-overlay[hidden] { display: none; }` to fix

2026-02-05 — Feature: Hints & Endless Mode
- Added "Details" hint area below the rendered preview in Practice
  - Shows invisible info the user needs: URLs, link titles, alt text, image URLs
  - Only appears when the challenge has hints (links, images, mixed/advanced)
  - Styled with dashed border, accent-colored label, code-styled values
- Practice is now endless: tiers wrap from 9 → 1 instead of stopping
  - Arrow buttons and auto-advance both wrap
  - Arrows are never disabled
- Generators for Links & Images and Mixed/Advanced tiers now return hints arrays
